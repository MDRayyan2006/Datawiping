## Usage

### First Time Setup
1. Launch the app
2. Complete the onboarding process with your details
3. Verify device detection is working
4. Configure API settings if needed

### Starting a Wipe Operation
1. Navigate to the Wipe screen
2. Select a device from the detected devices
3. Choose a wipe method (DoD, NIST, Gutmann, etc.)
4. Specify the target path
5. Configure options (certificate generation, mock mode)
6. Confirm the operation
7. Monitor progress in the History screen

### Managing Certificates
1. View completed jobs in the History screen
2. Tap on a job to see details
3. Download certificates in PDF or JSON format
4. Verify certificates online

## API Integration

The app integrates with the following FastAPI endpoints:

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /auth/profile/{user_id}` - Get user profile
- `PUT /auth/profile/{user_id}` - Update user profile

### Devices
- `GET /devices/` - List all devices
- `GET /devices/summary` - Device statistics
- `GET /devices/{device_serial}` - Get specific device

### Jobs
- `POST /jobs/start` - Start wipe job
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/status` - Get job status
- `GET /jobs/` - List jobs
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/cancel` - Cancel job

### Certificates
- `GET /certificates/` - List certificates
- `GET /downloads/certificate/{id}/pdf` - Download PDF
- `GET /downloads/certificate/{id}/json` - Download JSON

## Security Features

- **Digital Signatures**: All certificates are cryptographically signed
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS support for API communication
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without sensitive data exposure

## Testing
